# About this repo
Final Project for the CMS course with EC Utbildning.

## For the passing grade

In this project you need to build a CMS system with the help of Umbraco and build specific functionality. 

- Set up an Umbraco project
- Design the homepage and contact page according to the specified design 
- Navigation between sites should work
- All text should be dynamic and interchangeable with Umbraco

## For the good grade

- All requirements for passing grade should be met
- An admin should be able to log into Umbraco
- An admin should be alble to add products to a database via Umbraco
- Products added should be displayed on the site so all users can see them


### Known issues

Since the Update to Umbraco 11.1.0 certain CSS features no longer work. Hover effects in the navbar won't take
and the entire product category won't display correctly. The styling seems completely off for this entire section.
